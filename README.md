To get started, either clone this repository to your local machine, or create a
Codespace, then open the file `lessons/00_Getting_Started/README.md`. This will
give you an overview of the module and how to get started.


There are three directories in this module that you will work in: 

1. `lessons` - This is where you will find the lessons and assignments for the module.
2. `games` - The games you will create will be in this directory.
3. `examples` - This is where you will find examples of games that you can run and learn from.
