# Python Games: Getting Started

Welcome to the second module of The LEAGUE's Python curriculum. This module is all about games, 
and it works a bit differently than the previous modules. Instead of learning a series of lessons, 
you will be building games using PyGame by reading and analysing existing Pygame programs. 

## Viewing Lesson Files

You will see three kinds of files in these lessons:

1. README.md files - README files introduce the lessons. 
2. Jupyter Notebook files - These files have the extension '.ipynb' and are used
   to run Python code. They are rendered very nicely in GitHub and VS Code, so
   we use them for most content. They are also executable, so you can run the
   code in them.
3. Python files - These files have the extension '.py' and are used to run Python
   code.

Of course, you will need to use your IDE, like VS Code, to run the Python files,
but you have some options for viewing the Jupyter Notebook files. You can view
them in GitHub, or you can open them in VS Code.

Viewing the files on the GitHub website is easy. Just vist the [GitHub Repository here](https://github.com/league-curriculum/Python-Games) 
and view the file you want. We recommend usig GitHub to view the lesson files so oyou don't
have to switch between windows a lot in VS Code. 


## Reading Code

There will only be a few traditional lessons in this module, and they will be
short. Most of what you will learn will be from reading and analyzing code. This
is a very important skill for a programmer. Each lesson or assignment will be in
a directory with a README.md file that will explain what you need to do.

You will also need to read the Pygame documentation sometimes. You can find it
at:

[https://www.pygame.org/docs/](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)

If you like extra help, you can also find many tutorials on the web. One of the
best video tutorials is [The Ultimate Introduction to PyGame](https://youtu.be/AY9MnQ4x3zk?si=HFtptJF9MVeq-hFO)


## Opening Your Virtual Screen

Since you will likely be working in a Codespace, you will need to open a virtual
screen to run your Pygame programs. To do this [follow these instuctions](https://curriculum.jointheleague.org/howto/python_codespaces.html#open-a-virtual-screen-on-the-web)


## Important Tips

There are two ways to run a program. One is to use the  "Run" button at the top
of the screen. This will run the program in the terminal window at the bottom of
the screen. This will run the program in the terminal like a normal program. If
you do this, you will need to close the program clicking the close button on the
game window, or by hitting `Ctrl+C` in the terminal window.

The other way is by running with the debugger, which will give you more control.
Hit the F5 key to run the program with the debugger. The first time you do this
for a program, you will need to select an option from a window at the top of the
screen. 

When you run with the debugger, you can stop the program by hitting the red
square in the debugger window. Select the first option, "Python Debugger".  Then
you will get the debugger control window. You can use the buttons at the top of
the window to step through the program, or to stop it. The debugger window looks
like:

The red square will stop your program, and the green reverse circle wil restart
it. The other buttons will let you step through the program.

## Next Steps

Don't forget about the [Pygame Documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/index.html). Your programs will
get better the more you know about Pygame.

Now go to the next lesson, [lessons/01_Motion_and_Physics/01_Motion_and_Physics.ipynb](../01_Motion_and_Physics/01_Motion_and_Physics.ipynb) to start learning how to move things around the screen.
