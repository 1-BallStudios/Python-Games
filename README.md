# Python Games

If you have completed the League's [Python Apprentice](
https://python-apprentice.jointheleague.org/) class, you are ready to continue
your Python journey by learning to program games. 

To get started, either clone this repository to your local machine, or fork and
create a Codespace, then open the file [lessons/00_Getting_Started/README.md](lessons/00_Getting_Started/README.md).
This will give you an overview of the module and how to get started.

There are three directories in this module that you will work in: 

1. `lessons` - This is where you will find the lessons and assignments for the module.
2. `games` - The games you will create will be in this directory.
3. `examples` - This is where you will find examples of games that you can run and learn from.

Start in the `lessons` directory for the first lesson, or you can try out a few of the
games in the `games` directory. The lessons will refer to the `examples` directory for 
examples of code that you can run and learn from.

## Next Steps

Open the file [lessons/00_Getting_Started/README.md](lessons/00_Getting_Started/README.md) to begin the lessons.
