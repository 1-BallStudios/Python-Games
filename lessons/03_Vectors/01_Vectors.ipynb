    "Our programs have been 2 dimensional, so we need to work with both x and y\n",
    "values. Now that we have a good understanding of how objects work, we can start\n",
    "working with vectors, which is an object that combines the x and y values into a\n",
    "single object. THere are two ways of thinking about vectors. One is as a\n",
    "position, which is a point in space. The other is as a direction and a\n",
    "magnitude, which is a line with a length and a direction.\n",

    "![Vector](images/vectors.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a vector that is a position, we can add two vectors together to get a\n",
    "new vector that is the sum of the two. This is called vector addition. If we\n",
    "have a vector that is a direction and magnitude, we can multiply the vector by a\n",
    "scalar ( a single number ) to get a new vector that is the original vector\n",
    "multiplied by the scalar. This is called scalar multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, suppose that we have a vector called `p1`, which is the position of the player, at\n",

    "from pygame.math import Vector2\n",
    "\n",
    "p1 = Vector2(100, 100)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose that we have a vector called `move`, which is the amount we want to move the player. We can move the player just by adding the move vector to the player vector. We can write this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "move = Vector2(10, 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "p1 += move\n",
    "```\n",

    "Or, suppose that we want to move the player 100 pixels in the direction of 45 degrees. We can write this as:\n",

    "move = Vector2(100, 0)\n",
    "move.rotate_ip(45) # rotate the vector \"in-place\"\n",
