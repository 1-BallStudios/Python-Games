# Python Games: Getting Started

Welcome to the second module of The LEAGUE's Python curriculum. This module is all about games, 
and it works a bit differently than the previous modules. Instead of learning a series of lessons, 
you will be building games using PyGame by reading and analysing existing Pygame programs. 

## Viewing Markdown Files

First things is that this curriculum will have many lesson files that will be in
the form of a README.md file. THe '.md' extension means "Markdown", which is a
way to format text. Its like a simple verions of HTML. While you can read
Markdown files in a text editor, they are best viewed in a Markdown viewer. If
the first line of this file looks like "# Python Games: Getting Started", then
you are reading this in a text editory, and you should open it in a Markdown
viewer.

To open the Markdown viewer, go to the file entry in the explorer window on the
left of the screen ( in VSCode ) and right click to get the pop up menu. Then
select "Open Preview". This will open the file in the Markdown viewer.

The Markdown files will nearly always becalled "README.md", but sometimes there will be
markdown files with other names. 

## Reading Code

There will only be a few traditional lessons in this module, and they will be
short. Most of what you will learn will be from reading and analyzing code. This
is a very important skill for a programmer. Each lesson or assignment will be in
a directory with a README.md file that will explain what you need to do.

You will also need to read the Pygame documentation. You can find it at:

[https://www.pygame.org/docs/](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)


## Assignment

1. Copy `examples/01-move.py` into this directory.
2. Run the program and see what it does.
3. Read the code and try to understand how it works.
4. Read the Pygame documentation for [pygame.draw](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html) and change the program to draw a circle. 
5. Read the documentation for [pygame.key](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html) and change the program to move the circle with the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys.
