# Gravity Bounce Object Style

Now that we have a basic understanding of how objects work, we can work on an
updated version of the Gravity Bounce program. 

## Assignment

1. Copy `03_gravity_bounce_obj.py` into this directory.
2. Review the program and try to understand how it works.
3. Change the program so that the player's initial velocity and position are set
   in the initializer to the `Player` class.
4. Add a color for the player, configurable in the initializer.
5. Add a second player to the game. The second player should be a different
   color and have different initial position and velocity.

When you are done, your program should have two player objects ( but only one
Player class!), of different colors, bouncing around in different trajectories.
