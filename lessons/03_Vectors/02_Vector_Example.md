# Vector Example Program

The program `examples/03c_vectors.py` is a simple program that demonstrates how
to use vectors to move an object around the screen.

![Vector Example](images/vector_example.png)


You can move the green line around the player with the left and right arrow
keys. The up and down arrow keys will make the line longer or shorter. When you
hit the space bar, the player will move along the green line to the new
position.

In this program, both the line and the player are represented with a vector. Read the
program to see how we use vectors to move the player along the line.
